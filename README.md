# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop by Kendra Fray

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I believe an improvement would be a page to add an online ordering for in cafe pickup option.
